- 👋 Hi, I’m Ayush Tripathi. A Data Scientist @ Fractal India. 
- 👀 I have a deep interest in learning new ML techniques and solving problems by developing AI solutions. Helps me master my skills and is fun to do (not gonna lie xD)
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring Classical ML algorithms and Neural Networks, and trying my hands on building mini projects around them. 
- 💞️ Really confused as to what I like the most - Reading, Food, Code, Creating? I guess I like to do it all. 
- 📫 I really believe in community based learning, so if you are also a DS/ML enthusiast and have great ideas and things to share, do drop me a note at ayusht239@gmail.com. Let's build great stuff together.
